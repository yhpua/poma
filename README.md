This webpage documents the
[functionality](https://yhpua.github.io/poma/) of the `poma` function
from the [`rms` R package](https://github.com/harrelfe/rms).

Users of this function should be mindful of the latest (and greatest)
thinking on [assessing the Proportional Odds Assumption and Its
Impact](https://www.fharrell.com/post/impactpo/). Wherever possible,
they should use the [`impactPO`
function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rms/versions/6.3-0/topics/impactPO).
